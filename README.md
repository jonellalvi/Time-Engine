# Time-Engine

Time Engine is my first web app. My goal with this project is to learn Python, Django, and JavaScript more deeply. 

Time Engine takes a series of events, an end date, and the available days, and determines the end date. 

For example, if you are teaching a curriculum that has 57 lessons, and classes are held on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, on what date will the class end?

Given a fixed number of sessions, which could be meetings in a series, chapters in a book, lectures in a class, etc., and a start date, figure out when you'll finish the series or class.

Results will be viewed on a calendar and a timeline. 

Possibilities for extension:

Given an end date and a series of sessions, chapters, lessons, etc. determine how many sessions/hours you'd need each day in order to complete the series by the deadline.

I hope to eventually add options to opt out of weekends, pick which days work happens etc.

I'd like to explore different visualization options as well.
